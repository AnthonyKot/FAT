  'Debt-to-Equity Ratio': 
    'The Debt-to-Equity ratio is crucial as it reveals how much a company is financing its operations through debt versus shareholder equity. A high ratio might indicate excessive leverage and financial risk, while a very low ratio might suggest underutilization of debt financing advantages. For technology companies, moderate debt levels can be beneficial for growth and R&D investment.',
  
  'R&D to Revenue': 
    'For technology companies, R&D to Revenue is a vital metric that indicates investment in future growth and innovation. High R&D spending relative to revenue suggests commitment to staying competitive through new product development, while low spending might signal potential future competitiveness issues. This metric helps predict long-term growth trajectory and technological leadership.',
  
  'Cash Conversion Cycle': 
    'The Cash Conversion Cycle measures how efficiently a company converts investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows. A shorter cycle indicates better operational efficiency and working capital management. For retail and manufacturing companies, this metric is particularly important as it directly impacts liquidity and the need for external financing.',
  
  'PEG Ratio': 
    'The Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio provides a more complete picture than the P/E ratio alone by factoring in expected earnings growth. A PEG ratio below 1 might indicate an undervalued stock relative to its growth prospects. This metric is especially valuable for evaluating growth companies in technology or emerging sectors.',
  
  'Free Cash Flow Yield': 
    'Free Cash Flow Yield measures a company\'s ability to generate cash relative to its market value. A high yield suggests the company is generating substantial cash that can be used for dividends, buybacks, debt reduction, or reinvestment. This metric helps identify companies with strong cash generation capabilities relative to their valuation.'
};

const mockDashboardAnalysis: Record<string, string> = {
  financialHealth: 
    'Analysis of the financial health metrics indicates a solid balance sheet with moderate leverage and strong liquidity position. The debt-to-equity ratio is within industry norms, while interest coverage suggests minimal concerns about debt servicing capacity. Particularly notable is the strong net cash position relative to EBITDA, providing ample flexibility for strategic investments or shareholder returns.',
  
  operationalEfficiency: 
    'The operational efficiency metrics reveal strong inventory management with turnover rates exceeding industry averages. The cash conversion cycle has improved by 15% year-over-year, indicating enhanced working capital management. Areas for potential improvement include accounts receivable management, where days sales outstanding exceeds peer benchmarks by approximately 8 days.',
  
  investorValue: 
    'From an investor value perspective, the company presents a mixed picture. While traditional valuation metrics like P/E and EV/EBITDA suggest premium pricing compared to peers, the PEG ratio indicates reasonable valuation when accounting for above-average growth expectations. The free cash flow yield of 3.8% supports the current dividend program while allowing for strategic reinvestment in the business.',
  
  researchInnovation: 
    'R&D investment metrics show an above-industry-average commitment to innovation, with R&D to revenue ratio in the top quartile of comparable firms. The efficiency of this spending appears strong based on new product revenue contribution and the ratio of revenue growth to R&D investment. Capital expenditure levels relative to depreciation suggest appropriate investment in maintaining and expanding technological infrastructure.'
