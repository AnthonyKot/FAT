## TODO this sprint

1. AI-driven Similarity and Recommendations

DR prompt "I need an article about comparing predicting specific company price based on historical key indicators (like PE, margin, profic and etc) other company but 1-2-3 years ago" + " I need an example of such framework applied to specific companies pairs. I care about indicators were used and selection of "similar" company approach (like calculation cos distance between indicators or something like that)"

Academic research has applied methods like k-medians clustering on financial ratios‚Äã
BACKOFFICE.BIBLIO.UGENT.BE
 and even cosine or Mahalanobis distance on entire financial statement vectors‚Äã
BACKOFFICE.BIBLIO.UGENT.BE
 to identify comparable firms

Implement AI-based sorting by similarity for companies.

Clearly label AI-suggested UI elements with an "‚ú® AI Recommended" badge.

Provide concise explanations next to highlighted UI elements explaining why they're recommended (e.g., "Research & Innovation identified as critical due to rapid industry changes affecting Adyen‚Äôs growth potential").

2. Actionable Insights on Selection

Upon initial stock selection, prompt users with actionable insights (e.g., "Did you know Alphabet's stock increased by X% compared to Apple this quarter?").

3. Competitor Selection Encouragement

Implement micro-copy or subtle animations encouraging users to select a competitor after choosing the primary stock (e.g., tooltip: "Select a competitor to reveal detailed comparative insights.").

4. Enhanced Search Result Clarity

Visually differentiate ticker symbols from company names (e.g., brighter font or distinct color).

Add industry/category tags (Tech, Financial, etc.) in the search dropdown to help users contextualize quickly.

5. Immediate Value upon Stock Selection from Search

Display brief key insights or recent highlights instantly after selection (e.g., ‚ÄúAdyen stock rose by 5% last week‚Äù).

6. Improved Comparative Chart Visualization

Implement dual-axis charts for clearer visualization when comparing stocks with significantly different prices.

7. Actionable Summary for Charts

Provide a short, highlighted summary beneath comparison charts (e.g., "Alphabet significantly outperformed Adyen during the selected period.").

8. Tooltips for Complex Financial Metrics

Add interactive tooltips or "?" icons for complex metrics like P/E Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Beta to improve user comprehension without navigating away from the current view.

Despite consistent profitability, valuation models indicate the stock price currently exceeds calculated intrinsic values under various scenarios. Tesla‚Äôs industry-leading technology, expanding production capacities, and strong brand equity sustain its dominant market position, though growing competition in the EV sector and regulatory risks remain key factors investors should monitor closely."

Provide a similarly structured, clear, and concise executive summary for the requested company."
```

üü° #2 Multi-year Price Horizon Analysis
Request Example:

"Could you provide Tesla price predictions for the next 2-3 years?"

Integration: Moderate complexity (clear prompt needed, plus careful communication about uncertainty)
Robustness: Generally robust if kept qualitative (scenario-based rather than specific price targets).
```
You're an AI financial analyst providing scenario-based multi-year price horizon analyses for publicly traded companies.

Provide a structured, insightful analysis outlining potential stock price scenarios for "[COMPANY_NAME]" ([TICKER]) over a 2-3 year horizon. 

Include the following clearly-defined scenarios:

1. **Optimistic Scenario**:
   - Key positive assumptions (e.g., rapid growth, increased profitability, market expansion).
   - Estimated price trajectory or valuation implications.

2. **Base Case Scenario**:
   - Most likely outcomes based on current trends.
   - Balanced assumptions regarding growth, market conditions, and profitability.
   - Estimated price trajectory or valuation implications.

3. **Pessimistic Scenario**:
   - Main risks or challenges (e.g., increased competition, regulatory pressures, declining margins).
   - Potential impact on stock price or valuation implications.

Provide each scenario briefly and clearly, helping investors understand plausible outcomes without implying certainty.

Format example:

**Optimistic Scenario**  
Assuming strong growth and sustained market leadership, stock price appreciation could reach X%-Y% over the next 2-3 years.

**Base Case Scenario**  
Moderate growth and stable market conditions suggest potential price appreciation of A%-B%.

**Pessimistic Scenario**  
Intensified competition or margin pressures may limit growth, with stock prices potentially remaining flat or declining by C%-D%.

Maintain clarity, brevity, and neutrality throughout your analysis.

```

üóíÔ∏è Recommendations:
Start with Trending Comparisons and Industry-Specific Metrics, as these will quickly demonstrate tangible value with minimal complexity.
Follow up with Executive Summaries and Multi-year Price Horizon Analysis after verifying reliability and prompt effectiveness.
Consider the Specific Metric Categories last, as these may require more refinement and experimentation.
