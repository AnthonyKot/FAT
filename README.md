# FinCompare - Financial Data Comparison Tool

A web application for comparing financial data between companies and their competitors, helping users make informed investment decisions.

## Project Overview

FinCompare provides a comprehensive platform for financial analysis, allowing users to:

1. Select a company (e.g., Apple, Google, Tesla) from a list of available options
2. Choose a competitor to compare against
3. View detailed financial information across multiple dimensions:
   - Overview dashboard with key metrics
   - Balance sheet comparison
   - Income statement analysis
   - Cash flow examination
   - Ratio analysis (valuation, profitability, growth, risk, efficiency)

## Key Features

### Company Selection
- Choose a main company for analysis
- Select a competitor for comparison from a filtered list

### Overview Dashboard
- At-a-glance view of key company metrics (market cap, current price, 52-week high/low)
- Key performance indicators showing year-over-year growth
- Revenue comparison charts
- Profit margin trends
- Valuation ratios visualization
- Summary analysis of financial performance

### Detailed Financial Statements
- **Balance Sheet**: View assets, liabilities, and equity with detailed line items
- **Income Statement**: Revenue, expenses, and profitability metrics
- **Cash Flow**: Operating, investing, and financing cash flows

### Ratio Analysis
- Interactive ratio selector by category (valuation, profitability, growth, risk, efficiency)
- Explanations of each ratio's significance
- Trend charts showing historical performance
- Side-by-side comparison with competitors
- Analysis summary with investment implications

### Interactive Visualizations
- Responsive charts that adapt to the selected timeframe (1Y, 3Y, 5Y)
- Clearly color-coded comparisons between companies
- Tabular data for detailed number examination

## Technical Details

This application is built with:
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Canvas-based financial charts (Note: In a production environment, a library like Chart.js would be used)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

## Data Source

Currently, the application uses mock data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would be connected to a financial data API like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or a similar service.

## TODO: Real Data Integration with FinancialModelingPrep API

The application will be enhanced to use real financial data from the FinancialModelingPrep.com API. The free tier of this API provides access to essential financial data that can replace our mock data.

### API Integration Tasks

1. **Setup API Configuration**
   - Create an environment variable for the API key
   - Implement API client utility with proper error handling and rate limiting

2. **Data Endpoints to Integrate**
   - Company Profile (`/api/v3/profile/{ticker}`) - For company overview data
   - Financial Statements:
     - Income Statement (`/api/v3/income-statement/{ticker}?limit=5`) - Last 5 years
     - Balance Sheet (`/api/v3/balance-sheet-statement/{ticker}?limit=5`) - Last 5 years
     - Cash Flow Statement (`/api/v3/cash-flow-statement/{ticker}?limit=5`) - Last 5 years
   - Key Metrics (`/api/v3/key-metrics/{ticker}?limit=5`) - For ratio analysis
   - Financial Growth (`/api/v3/financial-growth/{ticker}?limit=5`) - For YoY growth metrics
   - Stock Price History (`/api/v3/historical-price-full/{ticker}?from={date}&to={date}`) - For stock chart

3. **Data Transformation Layer**
   - Create adapter functions to transform API responses to match our application data model
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Add loading states for data fetching

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add company search functionality (using `/api/v3/search?query={query}`)
   - Implement error handling for failed API requests
   - Add last updated timestamp for real-time data

### Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Core company data and financial statements integration
- Phase 2: Ratios and metrics integration
- Phase 3: Stock price history and charts
- Phase 4: Search and discovery features

### How to Enable Real API Integration

To use the FinancialModelingPrep API instead of mock data:

1. Open `src/utils/config.ts`
2. Add your API key to the `FMP_API_KEY` field:
   ```typescript
   FMP_API_KEY: 'your-api-key-here',
   ```
3. Set the feature flag to enable the real API:
   ```typescript
   FEATURES: {
     // Enable real API integration
     ENABLE_REAL_API: true,
     // Other feature flags...
   }
   ```
4. Restart your development server

The application will display an indicator at the bottom of the page showing which data source is being used. If there's an issue with the API, it will automatically fall back to using mock data.
